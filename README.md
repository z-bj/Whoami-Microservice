Whoami Microservice is a request header Parser that extracts and returns a JSON object containing the IP address, language, and software keys from the request header.

This project is my solution for the APIs and Microservices Projects - Request Header Parser Microservice, which is part of the APIs and Microservices Certification by freeCodeCamp.

## Features

-   Parses request headers to extract IP address, language, and software information.
-   Returns a JSON object with IP address, language, and software information.
-   Provides a simple solution for implementing a request header parser microservice.

## Requirements

To meet the requirements of the project, the microservice should:

-   Return a JSON object with the IP address in the ipaddress key when the endpoint /api/whoami is accessed.
-   Return a JSON object with the preferred language in the language key when the endpoint /api/whoami is accessed.
-   Return a JSON object with the software in the software key when the endpoint /api/whoami is accessed.

## Installation

To install and run the project:

1.  Install dependencies using the following command:
    

    
    ``` bash
    
    npm install
    
    ```
    
2.  Start the server using the following command:
    

    
    ``` bash

    node index.js

    ```
    

By following these simple steps, you can quickly get the project up and running on your local machine.

I hope you find this project useful and informative. Thank you for checking it out!
